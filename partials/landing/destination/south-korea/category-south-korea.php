			When people think of travel in South Korea, things like cheap cosmetics from Seoul and tangerines from Jeju island usually spring up. But there's so much more to see and do in the land of Kimchi!
		</p>
		<p>
			The K-POP explosion had opened the doors to newer and more happening things to do, such as cafe-hopping in the quaint, artistic streets of Garosu-gil, Seoul, or exploring the murals in Gamcheon Culture Village, Busan, or tucking into a gorgeous bowl of Pat-bingsu along the shopping and food street near Ehwa Womanâ€™s University.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that the language barrier is being bridged by translations available online as well as within Korea, it's getting easier to make your way around this exciting country. Start planning your new Korean adventure today!
